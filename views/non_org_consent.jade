              | Prizm is an app that helps students explore opportunities 
              | related to their futures, whether it's college, scholarship, 
              | or career information.

              | When creating an account, your child provides his/her name, 
              | email address, zip code and date of birth.

                | We do not rent or sell any personal data and there are no ads 
                | on Prizm.

                  | posts by other members of the Prizm community.
                li 
                  | Prizm will occasionally send college, scholarship, and future 
                  | career information to your child based on his/her selected 
                  | interests and demographic information.

                  | Your child may choose to post pictures to their Prizm profiles,
                  | but because he/she is under 13, his/her posts will only be 
                  | seen by other members that your child actively selects to be 
                  | in his/her "Trust". Older members have
                  | the choice to share posts with just their Trust
                  | or share with the whole Prizm community.
